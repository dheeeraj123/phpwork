<h3>Front End</h3>
<p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.

    The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.
    
    You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
    
    The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<h3>Back End</h3>
<p>Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you canâ€™t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.

    On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product managers, principal architects, and website testers to build the structure of a website or mobile app. Back-end developers must be familiar with many kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and Ruby. They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to front-end user requests.</p>
